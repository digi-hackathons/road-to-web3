# Our Vision
What would the world be like where you could earn money while learning something new?

### Evolving society with decentralized education

This is what we would like to achieve.
LingoSwap is an educational community providing Learn2Earn app, a totally different style of learning.

There are so many people in the world who can't have an access to good education.
Our team strongly believe that an education is the most important solutions to achieve the peaceful world and financial independence of individuals.

NFTs,Web3 Dapps have revolutionally changed the profit distribution system of our world. 

We leverage the features of blockchain techonlogy to achieve the goal.

Our journey begins with language.

6.(when you are teacher)When your quiz is published and solved by someone, you will get small token.


# What's new?

# The Future of LingoSwap
We will expand the category of learning.
Especially, programming category.
There are millions of tech jobs in the world and the number of that has been increasing year after year.
